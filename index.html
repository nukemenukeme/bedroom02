    <h3>Our bedroom is coming back to the internet!</h3>
    <p>
      For the second time,
      it will take place in cooperation with <a href="http://www.printscreenfestival.com/" target="_blank">Print Screen
      Festival</a>
      which is held in Holon, Israel -- just outside of Tel Aviv.
      We might be sleeping beside people who sleep at an international media arts festival venue,
      kept open 24 hours through the night.
      So let’s have an online sleepover and bring a night into the internet <br/>
      Again!

    <p>
      No chatting or making a big noise will be permitted in the Internet Bedroom. The room is for sleeping! But feel
      free to snore or talk in your sleep.

    <h3>Ideas</h3>
    <p class="docblock">
      The internet is like a roaring noon 24 hours a day. Why don't we change a chatroom into a bedroom for our
      sleep?<br>
      Andy Warhol freed audiences from the act of watching a movie by screening actors’ sleep.
      Laurie Anderson connected the world through her subconscious by sleeping in public spaces.
      Qanta Simizu, who is one of vendors of the Internet Yami-Ichi market organized by IDPW,
      connected visitors with his father (who had been sleeping in a distant place) via web broadcast and haptic
      sense.
      The act of sleeping might bring new forms of communication on the internet. <br>
      There now, let’s go to a sleepover night on the internet, where we see a dream of electric sheep together with
      bots!<br>
      When day and night are connected, the internet might take a step closer to Nature.<br>
